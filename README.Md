## Description

As part of the Machine Learning course, each group of we were asked to work on an algothat meets the academic requirements for our RL exam. 
Thus, in a team we focused on a variant of the famous game Snake & Ladder. This variant of the game allows you to play with 3 different dice.
each with its own properties for advancing. The board has shortcuts and traps of different types that allow you to gain or lose time. 
The game also has two modes, ”circle” which turns the course into a continuous circle requiring the player to land precisely on the last one to finish the game; 
or ”no circle” which offers a classic course.
